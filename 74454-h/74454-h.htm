<h2>REPORT ON THE INDIAN SCHOOLS OF MANITOBA AND THE NORTHWEST
TERRITORIES.</h2>

<p>The story of the early explorations and of the trading adventures of
the French and English on the plains of the great Northwest has ever
been one of exceeding interest to the people of Canada; but while
filled with romance and important as illustrating how the great
domain has gradually been brought under the dominion of the British
Crown, it nevertheless is largely lacking as a record of the more
silent, yet more potent, influences which for over a century have
been at work transforming the Indian aborigines into members of a
civilized society and loyal subjects of the King. Restrained through
diplomacy, force and the interests of trade by the great fur-trading
companies, the widely distributed and wandering bands of Indians
would still have been savages, had it not been for the heroic
devotion of those missionaries who, attaching themselves to some
band, moved with it in its wanderings, or travelled from post to post
where the Indians were assembled while bartering their furs.</p>

<p>The evolution of schools amongst the Indian population of the
Northwest naturally begins with the efforts of the early missionaries
to obtain an influence over the Indians through the education and
guidance of the children. The Roman Catholic Church as early as 1817
sent its first missionary into this extensive region and its work
has been extended to far within the Arctic Circle, reaching even to
the Northern Ocean. Co-incident with its work has been that of the
Church of England, whose missionaries, locating near some Hudson&#8217;s
Bay Company&#8217;s trading post, have covered, through the work of the
Church of England Missionary Society, the entire Northwest to Fort
McPherson and the Yukon. To illustrate&#8212;the first Anglican mission
was established at Winnipeg in 1820, Dynevor in 1833, Cumberland in
1840, Lac la Ronge in 1840, Battleford in 1876, the Blood Mission
in 1880, Fort Simpson in 1858, Fort McPherson in 1874, and Rampart
House in 1882. The British Methodist Church began its labours by
establishing missions on Lake Winnipeg at Norway House and Berens
River in 1856, gradually extending westward as far as the Stony
reserve in the foothills of the Rockies. The Presbyterian Church,
latest in the field, started a mission at Prince Albert in 1867. The
stories of hardship and of danger endured by these missionaries of
the Cross have been but incidentally told, but the results are shown
in the list of missions and of day schools in existence when this
enormous territory passed into the hands of the Dominion of Canada
in 1870. The lists are very incomplete, but a published report shows
that 20 Roman Catholic schools and 5 Church of England schools
received in 1877 some financial aid from the Dominion government. The
following statement, taken from a report published in 1897, gives the
total grants made by the government to the schools of the different
churches in the years 1877, 1886, 1896 and 1906:&#8212;</p><!-- page 8 -->

<p>Thus the connection of the Dominion government with the Indian
schools of the Northwest began in 1871, when on August 3, the first
treaty, extinguishing the Indians&#8217; title to the lands within the
boundaries of southeastern Manitoba, was signed. The dates of the
several treaties were:&#8212;</p>

<p>As the terms of all these treaties were much the same, some of the
particulars may be quoted;</p>

<p>They provided:&#8212;</p>

<ul>
<li>1st. That sufficient land be reserved to give 160 acres to each family of 5.</li>
<li>2nd. For prohibiting the sale of intoxicants.</li>
<li>3rd. A present of three dollars per capita to the Indians on the reserve.</li>
<li>4th. That schools would be provided for the Indians.</li>
</ul>

<p>At Confederation in 1867 it was agreed that the Indian Department
should contribute an amount equal to that contributed by the
Methodist Church for schools in Ontario and Quebec, provided the sum
did not exceed $1,000. Hence it was natural and easy, apart from
treaty engagements, for the government to extend this principle to
the schools of the newly acquired Northwest Territories. There
appears a memorandum of Sir John A. Macdonald, dated October 19,
1880, fixing the salary of $300 to be given each day school teacher
in Manitoba and the Territories. It also states that if the
attendance should fall short of 25 in any quarter, the teacher should
be paid at a per capita rate of $3 per quarter; in the case of
non-denominational schools, it was considered that teachers should be
paid a maximum salary of $504, or at the rate of $12 per annum for 42
pupils; if the attendance be short of this number, the teacher should
receive $3 per pupil for the quarter. The same memorandum provided
prizes or bonuses to the teachers of the five best conducted schools
in Manitoba and the Northwest.</p>

<p>In the annual report for 1881, Commissioner Dewdney states:&#8212;&#8216;There
are now 20 schools and missions in the Northwest Territories, 12 of
which are receiving government aid; 9 are Church of England, 6 Roman
Catholic, 4 Canada Methodist, and 1 Presbyterian. There are now 11
school-houses under construction or completed, for which teachers
will be required during the coming season. We find considerable
difficulty in securing teachers for schools where the number of
children is small and is<!-- page 10 --> not likely to increase to an extent
sufficient to make the per capita remuneration attractive, and I
would recommend that in these cases a fixed sum be granted, say
two-thirds (&#8532;) of the maximum allowed by order in council of 19th
October, 1880.&#8217; The same report shows that grants were paid to the
following additional schools, 10 of which were in Superintendent
Graham&#8217;s inspectorate:&#8212;</p>

<p>Inspector Graham says in the same report: &#8216;I find it very difficult
to secure the services of competent teachers for the schools in
Treaties 3 and 5 owing to the difficulty of getting there and the
high prices charged for provisions, &amp;c., and being cut off from any
mail communication.&#8217;</p>

<p>The total amount paid by the government as salaries to teachers that
year in these 31 schools was $3,227.50, or roughly, $100 per school.</p>

<p>In the same appendix may be found items for building materials and
for erecting buildings at several points.</p>

<p>These quotations serve very well to indicate the embryonic condition
of the Indian school system, if it may be so called, in the
Northwest, and regarding which the adoption in 1884 of the industrial
school idea seems to have been a necessary growth.</p>

<p>Such was the general condition when in 1879 Mr. N. F. Davin was
appointed a commissioner to report on the establishment of industrial
schools in the Northwest. A comprehensive report, dated March 14,
1879, was the result of his investigations. In his conclusions he
says:&#8212;&#8216;I should recommend at once an extensive application of the
principle of industrial boarding schools in the Northwest, were it
not that the population is so largely migratory that any great outlay
at present would be money thrown away.&#8217; He also recommends&#8212;</p>

<ul>
<li>1st. Wherever the missionaries have schools, those schools should be
utilized by the government if possible; that is to say, a contract
should be made with the religious body controlling the school to
board, educate and train industrially a certain number of pupils.</li>

<li>2nd. Not more than four industrial schools should be established at
first.</li>

<li>3rd. That one be established at the junction of the north and south
Saskatchewan near Prince Albert, under the Episcopal Church.</li>

<li>4th. Advises one near Old Fort Bow, near the Stonies and Blackfeet.</li>

<li>5th. Advises that there be one at Qu&#8217;Appelle under the Roman
Catholic Church.</li>

<li>6th. Advises that there be one established on Riding Mountain, under
the Presbyterian Church.</li>
</ul>

<p>The report says:&#8212;&#8216;The importance of denominational schools at the
outset must be obvious.... Where, however, the poor Indian has been
brought face to face with polemics and settlements are divided, or
think they are divided, on metaphysical niceties, the school should
be, as at the White Earth Agency, Minnesota, undenominational.&#8217;
It further advises &#8216;that, as bands become more amenable to the
restraints of civilization, <i>education should be made compulsory</i>.&#8217;
Also that &#8216;the character of the teacher, morally and intellectually,
is a matter of vital importance; if he is morally weak, whatever his
intellectual qualifications may be, he is worse than no teacher at
all; if he is poorly instructed or feeble in brain, he only acts
every day an elaborate farce.&#8217; The report also advises competent
inspection and that special advantages be given to boys and girls
showing special aptitudes, and finally that, &#8216;the salary of a teacher
must be such as will induce good men to offer themselves&#8217; ... &#8216;in
the future when the manual labour boarding schools are established
institutions, these teachers, who manage these schools in a manner
toward self-support, should have a percentage in the reduction in the
cost of management.&#8217;</p><!-- page 11 -->

<p>The report formed the basis, apparently, of the action taken
subsequently in 1883, when a grant of $44,000 was made by parliament
to establish three industrial schools.</p>

<p>In the annual report of 1881, Commissioner Dewdney states that he
hopes to have selections made of localities for the three proposed
industrial schools.</p>

<p>On July 19, 1883, an order in council was passed adopting the
recommendation of a report of the Superintendent General of Indian
Affairs by the Deputy, Mr. Vankoughnet, in which it was ordered:&#8212;</p>

<ul>
<li>1st. That the Government buildings at Battleford be at once utilized
for the purpose of a Protestant institution, and that the Rev. T.
Clark be appointed principal at a salary of $1,200.</li>

<li>2nd. That the staff consist of an assistant to the principal, a
matron, a farmer and a cook, and that the assistant be a layman.</li>

<li>3rd. That the Commissioner determine whether the pupils be taken from
one tribe, or independently from all the bands in a given area.</li>

<li>4th. That the Commissioner be charged with the duty of seeing that
the buildings are fitted up.</li>

<li>5th. The minister recommends that a Roman Catholic industrial school
at or near Qu&#8217;Appelle be established with the same staff as at
Battleford, and that the selection of the principal be left with the
Archbishop of St. Boniface.</li>

<li>6th. The minister also recommends that a Roman Catholic industrial
school be established at some point in Treaty 7, and that the
selection of the principal be left to the Bishop of St. Albert.</li>

<li>7th. That the Commissioner&#8217;s attention be especially drawn to the
confidential report of Mr. N. F. Davin on the subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>The maintenance of the industrial schools from the period of their
establishment in 1884 was assumed wholly by the department; while
on October 22, 1892, an order in council was passed, intended to
regulate the matter of their expenses. This document, which since
then has governed generally the management of the industrial schools,
is so important that it is inserted here:&#8212;</p>

<p>The following is a copy of the order in council of October 22, 1892,
providing for the carrying on of industrial schools in Manitoba and
the Northwest Territories:&#8212;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&#8216;On a report dated 17th October, 1892, from the Superintendent
General of Indian Affairs stating that it is advisable to make a
change in the manner of carrying on those industrial schools in the
Northwest that are wholly supported by the government. The cost of
those institutions is larger, it is thought, than that for which they
might be conducted, and with a view to more economical management it
is advisable and necessary to adopt some method which would relieve
the pressure of the present expenditure and at the same time keep up
the schools to an equal standard of efficiency and usefulness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The minister considers that when the whole cost of an institution
is directly borne by the government the same economy by those in
immediate charge is not used as would be employed under other
conditions. Demands, under the present system, are frequently made
for articles and supplies, whereas if the amount to be expended were
to take the form more of an annual <i>per capita</i> grant, more effort
in the way of economizing would be made.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The minister states that the actual cost to the government, as shown
under the head of industrial schools, does not represent the total
expenditure which the present system entails, as there is a small
expense in the purchasing and inspection of supplies to be added.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The accounts for the past year (1890&#8211;91) show that the <i>per capita</i>
cost of each child at the industrial schools under consideration
was:&#8212;</p>

<table class="paddedtable">
<tr>
<td>Qu&#8217;Appelle</td>
<td class="num">$134&#8239;67</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Battleford</td>
<td class="num">175&#8239;45</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High River</td>
<td class="num">185&#8239;55</td>
</tr>
</table>

<!-- page 12 -->
<p>&#8216;The rate <i>per capita</i>, it is thought, is higher than it would be
if a forced system of economy were exercised, and that the best
way to effect the desired decrease would be to place the schools
under a <i>per capita</i> grant system similar to that now in operation
at Elkhorn and St. Paul&#8217;s under Church of England authorities, St.
Boniface and Kootenay under Roman Catholic Church authorities. The
<i>per capita</i> system under which these schools are operated by
religious bodies has been found to work satisfactorily.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The minister therefore recommends that the following be applied to
the industrial schools in operation in the Northwest Territories,
and to such other similar institutions as may hereafter be
established, as soon as, in the opinion of the Indian Department,
said institutions are in proper running order, at rates to be fixed
upon as being fair and just, viz.:</p>

<ul>
<li>(1) The buildings are to be kept in repair jointly by the government
and the management,<!-- orig: managreement --> the former to furnish the material and the latter
to perform the labour.</li>

<li>(2) All books and appliances, that is, maps, globes, &amp;c., for
educational purposes, to be furnished by the government.</li>

<li>(3) All charges for maintenance, salaries and expenses to be paid by
the management, out of the <i>per capita</i> grant.</li>

<li>(4) The management not in any event to charge children or their
parents for being allowed to attend such institutions.</li>

<li>(5) The government to pay to the management an annual grant for each
pupil up to the number authorized by the Indian Department, as
represented by the commissioner, at the following rates:&#8212;

<table class="paddedtable">
<tr>
<td>Qu&#8217;Appelle</td><td class="num">$115&#8239;00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Regina</td><td class="num">120&#8239;00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Battleford</td><td class="num">140&#8239;00</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>High River</td><td class="num">130&#8239;00</td></tr>
</table></li>

<li>(6) For this consideration the management shall agree to conform to
the rules of the Indian Department, as laid down from time to time,
and to keep the schools at a certain standard of instruction, dietary
and domestic comfort, and that the inspectors and officers of the
Indian Department may at any time inspect and report upon the
institutions.</li>

<li>(7) Payment to be made only for children authorized by the
commissioner to be admitted, and in accordance with the scale now
governing payments to schools under the <i>per capita</i> system,
which may be altered from time to time to suit circumstances, and no
children, white or Indian, are to be admitted save under authority of
the commissioner.</li>

<li>(8) The minister deems it desirable to put this system into
operation after a reasonable time is given to the Church authorities,
and he recommends that the first of July, 1893, be fixed as the date
upon which the <i>per capita</i> allowances shall commence to be payable.</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8216;The committee submit the above for Your Excellency&#8217;s approval.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the <i>per capita</i> grant, the following concessions
have been made to schools established under the above order in
council:&#8212;</p>

<ol>
<li>That account books, stationery and an allowance for postage will
be given those institutions.</li>

<li>That strict accounts of all expenditure incurred on behalf of each
school, supported by vouchers, will be required by the department to
be kept in each institution, and at the expiration of each year, a
revision of the rate of capitation may be made should it appear that
such a step is considered necessary.</li>

<li>In the event of pupils over and above the number already
authorized and estimated for on the capitation system, being admitted
into a school, and for whom no provision has been made, beds for
occupation by such additional pupils are to be given by the
department, if they cannot be made in the institution.</li>

<li>In the event of the erection of new buildings at the expense of
the department becoming necessary, the cost of the heating apparatus
to be included in such cost.</li><!-- page 13 -->

<li>Agricultural and other implements, when considered by the
department as being unfit for further use, may be disposed of by the
officers of the institution in such manner as may be thought proper
by them.</li>

<li>The department will agree to provide sufficient grazing land for
use of each institution.</li>

<li>The department agrees to provide sufficient fencing material for
the first inclosure required, but the fences must be renewed at the
expense of the institution.</li>

<li>Medical attendance as directed by the commissioner for the pupils
of each institution will be provided and paid for by the department.</li>

<li>An advance of a sum to be agreed upon will, until further advice,
be made by the department to each institution at the commencement of
each quarter, to admit of the current expenses of that quarter being
defrayed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Such then was the beginning of what may be called secondary school
education amongst the Indians of the Northwest, and this, as will be
noticed, was coincident with the construction of the Canadian Pacific
railway, which was completed across the prairie and which event the
commissioner states would facilitate the movement of pupils and
supplies.</p>

<p>While the legal school age for admission is from 7 to 16 years, yet
children are admitted at 6 years, and are regularly graduated from
the industrial and boarding schools at 18 years, but the number
of persons between the ages of 7 to 17 inclusive in an average
population of 21,011 would be about 5,160, so that taking the average
attendance in all schools as 2,691, this amounts to but 52 per cent
of the Indian pupils of the ages between which children actually
attend school.</p>

<p>Reverting to the boarding and industrial school attendance, it is
found that a remarkable change has taken place in the relative

<h2>THE CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS ON INSPECTION.</h2>

<p>According to instructions I visited the industrial and boarding
schools of Manitoba and the Territories, during the months of March,
April and May, inspecting 35 in all and omitting the Pine Creek and
Sandy Bay boarding schools in Manitoba, and those of Kenora and
Cecilia Jeffrey in Ontario, which could not be reached on account
of freshets and ice. Neither were the schools at Fort Chipewyan and
Wabiscow Lake visited. Summarized details with regard to the several
schools will be found in tables VII. and VIII. of this report, and in
yet more detail in the original notes herewith transmitted. As might
be expected from the history of the schools, very great differences
exist, first in the age and character of the buildings, and secondly
in the internal school and dormitory space and in their sanitary and
general equipment. But as regards the general efficiency and even
the health of the children, it has been found that the extent of
the buildings, and even the number of the staff, are by no means
necessarily the measure of the success of any particular school
either as regards the numbers in attendance, the health of the pupils
or the discipline and effectiveness of the schools.</p>

<h3>THE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>The industrial schools now in operation, the details of the
inspection of which will be found in table VII., appended to this
report, are eight in number, and, as has been already pointed out,
have been carried on, some of them since 1884 at the cost of the
government, and with a large aggregate annual expenditure. The total
amount<!-- page 16 --> expended upon those in operation was $134,635.98 in 1905&#8211;6.
The original idea seems to have been to have them fairly convenient
to the railway, and yet at points about which there would be a group
of reserves, and from which their pupils were to be drawn.</p>

<p>As has been already statistically pointed out, there has been a very
notable falling off in the number of pupils since 1901, and this
tendency seems rather to increase than diminish. The reasons seem
chiefly to be:&#8212;</p>

<ol>
<li>The distance of the schools from the reserves.</li>

<li>The ineffectiveness of the staff in several instances.</li>

<li>The lack in practical success of the pupils after graduation.</li>

<li>The dependence of the number of pupils upon the co-operation of
the staffs of the boarding schools and upon the canvassing activity
of the principals of the industrial schools.</li>

<li>The lack of interest of Indian agents in schools at great
distances from their particular reserves.</li>

<li>The dislike of the parents to have their children so far from
home.</li>

<li>The great increase and enlargement of the boarding schools on or
near the reserves.</li>
</ol>

<p>With, perhaps, the exception of that of Brandon school, every
principal expressed the same opinion regarding the difficulty of
obtaining and retaining pupils, and all seem to feel that the
obligation, in practice if not in theory, which is placed upon them
of gathering pupils is not only disagreeable, but is further one
which takes them from their proper duties as administrators of the
school. However much force there may be in this contention, the fact
yet remains that it is only in four instances, those of Qu&#8217;Appelle,
High River, Brandon and Elkhorn, that the schools as regards either
numbers or effectiveness can be said to have held their own, and that
it is only in these that efficient staffs, energetic principals and
good discipline are to be found. When so remarkable and successful a
principal as Rev. Father Naessens, of High River, has to say that he
finds it difficult to maintain the number of his pupils, although
situated within the area whence he can draw from three of the largest
reserves, the Blackfeet, Bloods and Peigans, on all of which there
are Roman Catholic boarding schools, and when he says he is now
convinced that his school in order to do the best for his pupils,
ought, contrary to his former view, to be situated on or adjoining
some reserve, it seems evident that with boarding schools increasing
in numbers and in efficiency, the successful continuation of the
industrial schools under the present form must become increasingly
difficult and expensive.</p>


<h3>THE BOARDING SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>The origin and history of these schools, which have grown up as it
were between the two original types of schools, the day and the
industrial, is most interesting and instructive. The details of the
inspection of these schools will be found in table VIII., appended to
this report. A reference to table I will show that in 1886 scarcely a
single boarding school existed and that to-day we find their number
to be 38, with a total cost to the department of $98,688, and the
total pupils 1905&#8211;6, 1,739 as compared with (see tables III. and IV.)
694 in 74 day schools, and 693 in 8 industrial schools. It seems
evident, therefore, that there are in these boarding schools some
strong essentially vital forces which have enabled them to force
their way into their present dominant position. Summarized, these
seem to be:&#8212;</p>

<ol>
<li>Their location on, or in immediate proximity to, some Indian
reserve.</li>

<li>That with a few exceptions they have attached to them considerable
tracts of land, and are engaged in some instances even more
successfully than the industrial schools in agricultural operations
and practical outdoor work.</li>

<li>That their principals or some members of their establishment,
being usually missionaries, are more or less constantly and closely
in touch with the parents, whose<!-- page 17 --> children are to keep up the
supply of pupils, and who, if they be of the right spirit, are
constantly cultivating an interest in and sympathy for the school
amongst the members of the band, such as is impossible for the
principals of industrial schools unassociated with the reserves and
long distances from them.</li>

<li>The influence of a good master and spiritual adviser follows him,
the pupil, to the reserve, where he is encouraged and directed in
establishing himself in his future occupation on the reserve.</li>

<li>The usually smaller schools, less complex in their organization,
possess more of the elements of the family life of a home, and
necessarily the influence of the principal, matron and staff is
greater in the degree that their personality enters into the life of
the pupil.</li>
</ol>

<h2>THE HEALTH OF THE PUPILS OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND BOARDING SCHOOLS.</h2>


<p>When we know that it is only within the last ten years that what is
known as the &#8216;medical inspection of schools&#8217; has been undertaken in
the largest urban populations of this continent, it might be said
that it is not to be wondered at that in our Indian schools but
little of this work could hitherto have been expected. But the
circumstances in the two cases are quite different. In the public
school everywhere the child returns to its parents at night and they
are naturally chiefly responsible for its health. On the other hand,
our industrial and boarding schools have been for the full term of
residence in them the home of the child, and for his health the staff
of the school is immediately responsible. Not only so, but this fact
has been recognized by the government, which has for many years
appointed and paid medical officers for supervising the health of the
children. Nevertheless, it was natural, under what may be termed the
accidental circumstances under which, especially the day and boarding
schools were begun, and owing to the lack of any system under which
they came under government inspection that those teachers accustomed
daily to mingling with the Indians in camp would not exercise any
fine discrimination as to the degree of health of those admitted to
school. When in addition, in almost every instance, it was found
difficult to maintain the school attendance up to the number allowed
upon which the per capita payment was made, it is not surprising that
cases of scrofula and other forms of constitutional disease were
admitted into the schools. Such cases, under the defective sanitary
condition of many schools, especially in the matter of ventilation,
have been the foci from which disease, especially tubercular, has
spread, whether through direct infection, from person to person, or
indirectly through the infected dust of floors, school-rooms and
dormitories. That the actual situation has not been fully realized,
either by the staffs of the schools or by the medical officers except
in a few instances is shown by the reports received from month to
month and year to year by the department. This fact was fully borne
out by my own experience during the recent inspection. Principals and
teachers and even physicians were at times inclined to question or
minimize the dangers of infection from scrofulous or consumptive
pupils and nothing less than peremptory instructions as to how to
deal with cases of disease existing in the schools will eliminate
this ever-present danger of infection.</p>

<p>One of my special instructions was to obtain a statistical statement
of the past history and present condition of the health of the
children who have been pupils at the different schools. A list of
questions was, therefore, left with each principal, requiring that
they be answered and sent directly to my address in Ottawa. It is to
be regretted that more have not, up to date, been received, but the
following table from fifteen schools supplies much valuable
information and food for thought.</p><!-- page 18 -->

</table>

<p>Allowing for the defective way in which the returns have been made,
some returning the present condition of all pupils in school and of
all discharged as far as ascertained, while others have returned only
the status of ex-pupils, it appears that of 1,537 pupils returned
from 15 schools which have been in operation on an average of
fourteen years, 7 per cent are sick or in poor health and 24 per cent
are reported dead. But a close analysis of some of the returns
reveals an intimate relationship between the health of the pupils
while in the school and that of their early death subsequent to
discharge. Thus, of a total of 31 discharged from the File Hills
school, 9 died at the school, of 6 others there is no record of
condition on discharge, but all are reported to be dead, 7 others
died from within a few months to three years after discharge and 9
are reported as in good health, 7 being farmers or their wives at
the File Hills Colony, 1 a student, and 1 at Cot&#233;&#8217;s reserve. It is
most interesting to note that but 7 have been discharged during the
past 5 years and that of these 5 are File Hills Colony farmers, and
2 are dead. In every instance where the cause of the 21 deaths was
known, it is given as consumption or tuberculosis. I have referred in
detail to this school because of the definiteness of statement made,
giving an accurate picture of a school probably no worse than many
others, and within the last 5 years, under its present management,
notably better than many others. Changes in the principal and staff
of a school and lack of interest in discharged pupils make many
school records defective, and nothing less than a carefully carried
out correspondence could give us absolute data regarding all the
discharged pupils of the schools. It suffices for us to know,
however, that of a total of 1,537 pupils reported upon nearly 25 per
cent are dead, of one school with an absolutely accurate statement,
69 per cent of ex-pupils are dead, and that everywhere the almost
invariable cause of death given is tuberculosis. Wherever an answer
is given to the question, &#8216;Condition of child on entry?&#8217; it is
either not answered or given as &#8216;good&#8217;; so that we have during a
fifteen year period of school history, a study full of information
from the medical standpoint. A reference to the details contained in
tables VII. and VIII. shows<!-- orig: show --> that with but two or three exceptions no
serious attempt at the ventilation of dormitories or school-rooms has
hitherto been made; that the air-space of both is, in the absence of
regular and sufficient ventilation, extremely inadequate; that for at
least 7 months in the long winter of the west, double sashes are on
the windows in order to save fuel and maintain warmth and that for
some 10 continuous hours children are confined in dormitories, the
air of which, if pure to start with, has within 15 minutes become
polluted, so as to be capable of detection by ordinary chemical
tests. It is apparent that general<!-- page 19 --> ill health from the continued
inspiration of an air of increasing foulness is inevitable; but
when sometimes consumptive pupils and, very frequently, others with
discharging scrofulous glands, are present to add an infective
quality to the atmosphere, we have created a situation so dangerous
to health that I was often surprised that the results were not even
worse than they have been shown statistically to be. On the other
hand, there were two or three instances where the knowledge that
fresh air or oxygen is life has been positively realized, and where
fresh air is allowed to so pour into the dormitories that the air
breathed is that of the outer atmosphere. One principal in an
otherwise indifferent old school building said: &#8216;The medical officer
has not been here for eighteen months, for no one has been sick,
for when the wind is in the east we open the west windows and when
in the west we open the east and leave them open all night.&#8217; But,
however far one particularly clear-headed man may push this modern
gospel of fresh air, it is apparent that it is everywhere the
old-fashioned buildings, their very varied and imperfect methods of
heating and an almost complete lack of a knowledge of the meaning
of ventilation and of methods for accomplishing it in the different
schools, that are responsible for this most serious condition which
has been demonstrated and which demands an immediate remedy.</p>

<p>What further was very noticeable was the almost complete absence of
any drill or manual exercises amongst the boys or calisthenics or
breathing exercises amongst the girls. One would suppose that in
boarding schools the need for such exercises would be looked upon as
an elementary necessity; but it was found that it was only in some
isolated cases that it had ever been heard of or put into practice.
And yet the disciplinary value of such exercises, apart wholly from
their health value, is so obvious that one was not surprised at the
remark of that remarkable woman the Mother Superior of the St. Albert
Orphanage, who said that the musical tambourine drill (which I had
the pleasure of witnessing) was the first means she had discovered
of making the Indian children stand erect and raise their eyes.
Perhaps however, remembering the very varied types of teachers, the
difficulty often experienced in obtaining permanent ones of high
quality, and the sources from which they are drawn, it may be
expecting too much to suppose that so elementary a necessity of
school hygiene as physical exercises should have been a regular
part of the course in these schools.</p>
